Generate covers for your spotify playlists with AI

# ❗️What it does
Coverwave is a website that allows users to generate personalized album covers using artificial intelligence. By analyzing a user's Spotify playlists, the platform creates custom cover art that reflects the user's unique musical taste and style. The application utilizes advanced algorithms that consider various factors such as genre, mood, and tempo of the songs in the playlist to create stunning visual representations. Coverwave's intuitive interface and user-friendly features make it easy to generate album covers in just a few clicks.

# 💻How we built it
Our team member Sam helped us set up Live Share, which allowed us to collaborate on our code in real-time. We built a full-stack application, using Firebase as our main cloud platform for storing our generated images and Stable Diffusion for our generation. For the backend, we used a Spotify-web-API-node package that allowed us to connect to our Spotify accounts and retrieve data from it, such as our playlists or username.
